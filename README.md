# remaining-handles

Run via command line: python ./remainingUltraRareHandles.py

It will show on screen all remaining 2 Character handles still unminted.

Some unminted are reserved, so keep that in mind.

The 'possible_characters' variable can me modified to search for what Characters you want included.
