# How to Use

Run via command line: python ./remainingUltraRareHandles.py

It will show on screen all remaining 2 Character handles minted and unminted.

It will also output a txt file list of all remaining 2 Char handles left to be minted. 

Some unminted are reserved, so keep that in mind.

The 'possible_characters' variable can me modified to search for what Characters you want included.
